A community-maintained Python API for interacting with Prism pipeline tools in DCC applications like Maya and Houdini.

**Disclaimer:** This is an independent community project not affiliated with Prism Software GmbH.  
Official Prism website: [prism-pipeline.com](https://prism-pipeline.com/)

## Description

The Open Prism API provides a standardized interface to access some Prism pipeline functionality from within Digital Content Creation (DCC) applications. It offers methods to:

- Get project information (name, path, root folder)
- Check and manage Prism plugins (Maya, Houdini)
- Retrieve scene metadata (task, department, shot range)
- Generate export paths for products, media, and playblasts
- Manage versioning (setting master versions)
- Browse and request products

## Features

- **DCC Integration**: Automatic support for Prism inside Maya and Houdini
- **Standalone Mode**: You can set a standalone Prism core module with `set_core()` for partial DCC support
- **Project Management**: Access project names, paths, and configurations
- **Export Path Generation**: Create valid Prism export paths for various asset types
- **Version Control**: Set master versions for products and media
- **Scene Metadata**: Retrieve task, department, and shot information

## Installation

1. Place the `prism.py` file within your plugin directory or Python path (must be loaded by your DCC to be available)
2. Import in your scripts with `import prism`

## Compatibility

- Tested with Prism 2.0.13
- Compatible with Maya and Houdini
- Partial compatibility with other DCCs through `set_core()`

## Basic Usage

```python
import prism

# Check if Prism is available
if prism.is_prism():
    # Get current project info
    project_name = prism.get_project_name()
    project_path = prism.get_project_path()
    
    # Generate export path for a product
    export_path = prism.get_product_export_file_path("model", ".abc")
    
    # Get current scene task
    current_task = prism.get_task()
```
